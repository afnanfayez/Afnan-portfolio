      <h3>Hello, Myself</h3>
      <h1>Afnan Elzeity</h1>
      <h3>And I'm a <span class="multiple-text">Front End Developer</span></h3>
      <p>My name is Afnan Elzeity, I am 22 years old, and currently in my fourth year of studying Computer Systems
        Engineering. I am a passionate and dedicated learner in the field of Front-End Development, constantly striving
        to
        improve my skills and grow professionally. My journey in front-end development began with a deep curiosity about
        how websites are built and how user interfaces
        are designed. Over time, I developed a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I continue to enhance
        my
        abilities through practice and hands-on projects.

        Although I am still in the process of learning and growing, I am highly motivated and excited to become a
        skilled
        front-end developer. I am eager to face challenges, learn new technologies, and contribute meaningfully to
        impactful
        web projects.</p>

      <h3>Reason for <span>applying to this program</span></h3>
      <p>The reason I applied for this program is my great passion to develop myself in the field of front-end
        development, to
        learn React, and to design user-friendly and visually appealing interfaces using this powerful framework. Over
        the
        past months, I have dedicated myself to learning the core technologies of front-end development — HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript — and I have built a strong foundation in each of them through consistent self-study and practice. My
        academic excellence, proven by my high GPA and achievements, reflects my dedication and ability to grasp complex
        concepts. I am highly motivated, self-driven, and deeply enthusiastic about web development. I believe I truly
        deserve
        this opportunity, not only because of my technical potential, but also because of my commitment to continuous
        learning, my passion for building meaningful user experiences, and my determination to grow into a skilled and
        creative front-end developer.

        <h3>Front End Development</h3>
        <p>I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React by participating in a training program led by an Egyptian engineer
          through
          the SEF initiative. In addition to that, I have been actively developing my skills through self-study,
          utilizing
          platforms like YouTube and W3Schools. Throughout my journey, I have worked on various projects and completed
          numerous
          tasks that helped strengthen my understanding. I am deeply passionate about learning and continuously strive
          to master
          React.</p>

        <h3>Python development</h3>
        <p>I learned the basics of Python through several training programs with Gaza Sky Geeks (GSG), where I also had
          the
          opportunity to work on practical projects that strengthened my understanding. Later, I studied Python again at
          university in a course titled Advanced Programming, which further deepened my knowledge. I am still actively
          learning,
          practicing, and developing my Python skills, driven by my passion for continuous improvement.

        <h3>Problem Solving</h3>
        <p>I have learned C++ and Java, and I have studied important computer science fundamentals such as data
          structures,
          algorithms, and object-oriented programming (OOP). I have worked diligently to strengthen my problem-solving
          skills by
          tackling challenges on platforms like Codeforces and LeetCode. This consistent practice has
          helped me improve my logical thinking and coding efficiency, preparing me well for complex programming tasks
          and
          real-world software development.</p>
